# Andrew-Hughes-Chant

There are several files: (1) Andrew Hughes' original idiosyncratic notated Chant file â€“ encoded by a special format; (2) a script parsing the whole text file, extracting each song into a text file, and building the whole hierarchy readable file system which is indicated by the original text file (volumn, saint, service, etc.). (3) Two files named "Template" means they are used to generate ```.mei``` files. 

Keep the script and text file in the same directory. When you run the script, the whole file system containing all the text files, and the corresponding ```.mei``` files will display.

Now all ```.mei``` files contain pitches. Lyrics will be added underneath soon.

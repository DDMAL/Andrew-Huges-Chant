# Andrew-Hughes-Chant

There are two files: (1) Andrew Hughes' original idiosyncratic notated Chant file â€“ encoded by a special format; (2) a script parsing the whole text file, extracting each song into a text file, and building the whole hierarchy file system which is indicated by the original text file (volumn, saint, service, etc.).

Keep the script and text file in the same directory. When you run the script, the whole file system containing all the text files will display.

More scripts will be uploaded, decoding the text file and transforming it into ```.mei``` files, including pitches and lyrics.

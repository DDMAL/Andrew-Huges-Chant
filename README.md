# Andrew-Hughes-Chant

There are several files: (1) Andrew Hughes' original idiosyncratic notated Chant file â€“ encoded by a special format; (2) Two scripts parsing the whole text file, extracting each song into a text file, and building the whole hierarchy readable file system which is indicated by the original text file (volumn, saint, service, etc.), one generates ```.mei``` files with pitch and the other generates with pitch and lyrics. (3) Two files named "Template" means they are used to generate ```.mei``` files. (4) Two folders, one contains ```.mei``` files with pitch, the other contains pitch and lyrics.

Keep the script and text file in the same directory. When you run the script, the whole file system containing all the text files, and the corresponding ```.mei``` files will display.

Note that you need Python3 and cltk toolkit to run this script. You can install this toolkit simply by running: ``` pip3 install cltk```in the terminal.

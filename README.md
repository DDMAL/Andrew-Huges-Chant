# Andrew-Hughe's-Chant

So far in this repository, there are two files. One is the original Andrew Hughe's Chant file, which is encoded by a special format, and there is the script parsing the whole text file, extracting each song into a text file, and building the whole hierarchy file system which is indicated by the original text file (volumn, saint, service, etc.).

Keep the script and text file in the same directory, if you run the script, the whole file system containing all the text files will display.

Later on, more scripts will be uploaded, which will decode the text file and transform it into MEI format, with pitch and lyrics.

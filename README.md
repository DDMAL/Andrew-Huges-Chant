# Andrew-Hughes-Chant

There are several files: (1) Andrew Hughes' original idiosyncratic notated Chant file â€“ encoded by a special format; (2) Two scripts both parsing the whole text file, extracting each song into a text file, and building the whole hierarchy readable file system which is indicated by the original text file (volumn, saint, service, etc.), and one generates ```.mei``` files with pitch and the other generates with pitch and lyrics. (3) "Template" means they are used to generate ```.mei``` files using Pymei. (4) Two folders, one contains ```.mei``` files with pitch, the other contains pitch and lyrics.

Keep the script and text file in the same directory. When you run the script, the whole file system containing all the text files, and the corresponding ```.mei``` files will display.

Note that you need Python3 ,cltk, and Pymei toolkit to run this script. You can install cltk toolkit simply by running: ``` pip3 install cltk```in the terminal.
